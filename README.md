# NN_Password_Classifier
An attempt at a neural network version of my password classifier.

The results of this one weren't quite as pleasing as the GradientBoosting classifier.

This would not have been possible without the help from Francois Chollet's credit card fraud code example found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xL2jSdY-MGlN60gGuSH_L30P7kxxwUfM

His project was basically structured very similar to the task mine was to perform, so it allowed me to use his method of structuring the data once I extracted some features from my passwords.  His example was a really good resource for seeing how to set up the data to be used in a neural net -- something which I struggle with immensely at the moment.

The graph code block to visualize the progress and see overfitting was from Chollet's book 'Deep Learning with Python', which I highly recommend, as that is one of the foundational books that I read to really boost my ML into action.
